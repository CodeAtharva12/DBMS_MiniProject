Problem Statement:-

LIFESTREAM+ is a leading organization committed to ensuring the timely and safe availability of blood and its components to hospitals and patients in need. Despite advances in healthcare, many blood banks and hospitals continue to face significant challenges due to fragmented record-keeping, manual inventory tracking, and inefficient communication channels. These issues can cause delays in fulfilling urgent blood requests, wastage of blood units due to expiration, and difficulties in maintaining accurate donor and inventory records.

To address these challenges, LIFESTREAM+ is seeking a robust, database-driven Blood Bank Management System that will serve as a centralized platform for managing all aspects of blood donation and distribution. The primary goal is to enable hospitals to seamlessly connect with LIFESTREAM+, allowing them to register, place blood requests, and track the status of their requests through a secure and user-friendly portal. The system should empower LIFESTREAM+ administrators to efficiently manage donor registrations, monitor blood inventory levels by type and expiry, and oversee the approval workflow for hospital requests.

Key requirements include secure authentication and authorization to protect sensitive data, automated tracking of blood unit shelf life, and real-time updation of blood inventory. The platform should also support comprehensive donor management, ensuring that eligibility criteria and donation intervals are strictly enforced. Analytical reporting features are essential to aid LIFESTREAM+ in decision-making and resource planning.
The solution must be scalable, reliable, and designed to minimize manual processes and human error. By centralizing operations and streamlining communication between LIFESTREAM+ and its partner hospitals, the system will improve the efficiency, transparency, and responsiveness of blood supply management, ultimately enhancing patient care and saving lives.
